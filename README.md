Predicting Medical Insurance Costs Using XGBoost

Abstract
The escalating costs of medical insurance present multifaceted challenges for insurers,
policymakers, and individuals striving to balance affordability with comprehensive healthcare
coverage. Accurate prediction of these costs is paramount for setting equitable premiums,
optimizing resource allocation, and informing public health strategies. This study investigates the
application of XGBoost, a state-of-the-art gradient boosting algorithm, to predict medical
insurance costs using a publicly available dataset. By leveraging XGBoost’s ability to model
complex, non-linear relationships and handle skewed data distributions, the model achieves a
Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) of 1.0456, demonstrating superior predictive
accuracy compared to traditional linear models and other machine learning approaches such as
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forests. The results highlight XGBoost’s potential to
revolutionize insurance cost prediction, offering actionable insights for stakeholders across the
healthcare ecosystem. This paper provides an exhaustive analysis of the methodology, results,
and implications, while also exploring ethical considerations and future directions for enhancing
predictive modeling in this domain.
